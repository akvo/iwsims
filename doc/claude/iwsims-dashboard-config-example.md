# IWSIMS Dashboard Config — EPS Example

Frontend dashboard configuration for the IWSIMS EPS form family. Consumes the generic visualization API defined in [generic-visualization-api-spec.md](generic-visualization-api-spec.md).

**Form family**: EPS (Effective Protection System)
- Registration form: `1749623934933`
- Water Quality monitoring: `1749632545233`
- Construction monitoring: `1749624452908`

**Target route**: `/dashboard/1749623934933`

## Config Walkthrough (for reviewers & new teammates)

This section explains, top-to-bottom, what each block does and why it is shaped that way. Share this with anyone onboarding to the dashboard.

### 1. The mental model

The config is a **pure-frontend description of a dashboard**. The backend has three generic endpoints (`/values`, `/escalation/{form_id}`, `/progress/{form_id}`) that take query parameters. This JSON tells the frontend:

- which **form family** the dashboard belongs to,
- which **widgets** (KPIs, charts, tables, maps) to render,
- what **query parameters** to send for each widget,
- how to **lay them out** per tab,
- and which items are currently **hidden** (`hide: true`).

**Zero backend changes** are required to add, remove, or reshape widgets. Adding a dashboard for a new form family means creating a new JSON file and registering it.

### 2. Top-level keys

```
parent_form_id           // Anchors the dashboard to a registration form
name, description        // Display metadata
tabs[]                   // Top nav tabs
filters{}                // Filter bar (date, administration, custom)
kpis{}                   // KPI tile definitions
charts{}                 // Chart definitions
water_quality{}          // Parameters block (shared by microbial/physical/chemical sections)
progress{}               // Progress histograms (bucketed percentages)
escalation{}             // Escalation tables
map{}                    // Map widget
layout{}                 // Per-tab ordering: which KPIs/charts/tables appear where
```

Everything under `kpis`, `charts`, `water_quality.parameters`, `progress`, `escalation`, `map`, and `layout.sections` is a **definition** that is rendered only when referenced by `layout` — definitions and layout are separate on purpose. This way you can define a KPI once and reuse it across multiple tabs.

### 3. `tabs` — top navigation

```json
"tabs": [
  { "key": "monitoring_overview", "label": "Monitoring overview", "hide": false },
  { "key": "water_quality",        "label": "Water quality",        "hide": false },
  { "key": "construction_monitoring","label": "Construction monitoring","hide": false }
]
```

Each tab `key` must have a matching entry under `layout.{key}.sections`. Setting `hide: true` removes a tab entirely without touching its layout.

### 4. `filters` — the filter bar

Three parts: `date`, `administration`, `custom[]`.

#### 4.1 `filters.date`

```json
"date": {
  "label": "Monitoring Period",
  "date_question_ids": {
    "water_quality": 1749632545235,
    "construction":  1749624452911
  },
  "fiscal_year_start_month": 7,
  "hide": false
}
```

- `date_question_ids` maps a monitoring form family to the **question** that holds its "inspection date" (or equivalent). The dashboard has two monitoring forms, so each has its own date question. When a KPI/chart queries the water-quality form it sends `date_question_id=1749632545235`; construction queries send `date_question_id=1749624452911`.
- `fiscal_year_start_month: 7` defines July as the fiscal-year anchor for presets like "This fiscal year" (FY runs Jul → Jun). Set it to `1` for calendar-year accounting (Jan → Dec), `4` for India/UK tax year, `10` for US federal fiscal year. This is **frontend-only** — the backend only speaks in absolute `from_date`/`to_date`, so the frontend resolves the preset label into concrete dates before calling the API.

#### 4.2 `filters.administration`

Global admin-hierarchy filter that resolves to an `administration_id` query param sent to every API call. No IDs needed — uses the global admin tree.

#### 4.3 `filters.custom[]`

Free-form filters specific to this dashboard:

```json
{
  "key": "implementing_agency",
  "question_id": 1749624452993,
  "form_id": 1749623934933,
  "label": "Implementing Agency",
  "type": "multiple_option",
  "hide": false
}
```

Custom filters have a `form_id` because they only apply to API calls targeting that form (see "Filter propagation" below).

### 5. `kpis` — tile definitions

Each KPI is a named entry whose `api` block is the exact query-param payload passed to `/visualization/values`. For example:

```json
"under_construction": {
  "label": "Total EPS under construction",
  "color": "#fa8c16",
  "hide": false,
  "api": {
    "form_id": 1749624452908,
    "question_id": 1749630516826,
    "option_value": "no",
    "monitoring": "latest",
    "sum_by": "parent_id"
  }
}
```

Translated: "Hit `/visualization/values?form_id=1749624452908&question_id=1749630516826&option_value=no&monitoring=latest&sum_by=parent_id` and render the single returned number as a tile." The backend logic: count distinct parents whose latest construction answer is `no`.

A few KPIs use frontend-computed extensions — **hints** that the frontend expands into concrete `from_date`/`to_date` or additional filters before calling the API. They are not understood by the backend directly.

| Hint | Expansion |
|---|---|
| `rolling_months: 12` | `from_date = today - 12 months`, `to_date = today` (rolling window anchored at TODAY). Used by `monitored_last_12_months` / `water_sample_last_12_months`. |
| `fiscal_year: true` | `from_date` / `to_date` set to the current fiscal year's start/end, using `filters.date.fiscal_year_start_month`. Used by the `inspections_per_month` chart. |
| `past_due: true` | Adds `to_date = today - 1 day` against the chart's `deadline_question_id`, combined with `completion_question_id=<incomplete>`. Used by `construction_past_due`. |

### 6. `charts` — chart definitions

Same shape as `kpis` but with a `chart_type` (`doughnut`, `bar`, `line`) and a `config` block that passes through to akvo-charts as chart props. Three variants you will see:

1. **API-driven** (`operational_status`) — has an `api` block; the response is rendered directly.
2. **Composed** (`drinking_water_compliance`) — has `compute: "compliance"` + `compliance_params_ref: "water_quality.parameters"`. The frontend **does not** hit the backend for this chart; it runs each parameter's query and combines results locally. Rendered as a **stacked bar** with two x-axis categories — `Yes` (single "Compliant" stack segment) and `No` (one stack segment per failing parameter, so the bar's segments show *which* parameters drove non-compliance).
3. **Cross-referenced** (`construction_progression`) — has `source: "progress"` + `progress_ref: "construction"`, meaning "reuse the histogram computed by `/visualization/progress`, no extra API call."

The chart system uses a **"define once, reference anywhere"** pattern so one computation can drive multiple widgets.

### 7. `water_quality.parameters`

A **list** of water-quality parameters grouped by `microbial` | `physical` | `chemical`. Each parameter is a self-contained bar-chart definition:

```json
{
  "key": "ph",
  "label": "pH",
  "group": "chemical",
  "chart_type": "bar",
  "display": { "mode": "histogram", "bin_width": 0.5 },
  "threshold": { "min": 6.5, "max": 8.5 },
  "api": { ... }
}
```

`threshold` is used in two places:
- **Chart rendering** — draws a threshold line on the bar. `min` and `max` are both optional; provide `min` for two-sided ranges (e.g. pH).
- **Compliance computation** — each parameter contributes to the "drinking water compliance" stacked bar. An EPS is compliant only if **every** parameter answer satisfies both `min` (if set) and `max` (if set). Parameters a given EPS hasn't reported are treated as "no data" and do not count as a violation.

`display` controls how the per-EPS values are rendered:
- `mode: "per_eps"` (default if `display` is omitted) — one bar per EPS, x-axis = EPS name, y-axis = the measured value.
- `mode: "histogram"` — frontend bins each EPS's value into buckets of width `bin_width` (in the parameter's natural unit) and renders count-of-EPS per bin. The threshold becomes a `markLine` at the relevant x-axis value (or two lines for `{min, max}` bands like pH). Same `/values?...&group_by=parent_id` API call powers both modes — the transform is purely client-side, so the same response can also feed `compute: "compliance"`.

Layout sections reference groups via `parameter_grid.group = "microbial"`, which expands into all parameters with matching `group`.

### 8. `progress` — configurable histograms

```json
"progress": {
  "construction": {
    "api": {
      "form_id": 1749623934933,
      "monitoring_form_id": 1749624452908,
      "filter_question_id": 1749630516826,
      "filter_option_value": "no",
      "components": [
        { "key": "concrete_base", "formula": "any_yes", "question_ids": [...] },
        { "key": "urf_tank",      "formula": "completed_binary", "question_ids": [...] },
        { "key": "standpipes",    "formula": "ratio", "question_ids": [implemented_qid, planned_qid] },
        { "key": "site_security", "formula": "multi_select_proportion", "total_items": 3, "question_ids": [...] },
        { "key": "drainage",      "formula": "completed_binary", "hide": true, "question_ids": [] }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This maps directly to `/visualization/progress/{form_id}`. Each component declares a formula:

| Formula | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `any_yes` | 100% if any of the listed questions answered "yes" |
| `completed_binary` | 100% if the single question equals "completed" |
| `ratio` | `(implemented ÷ planned) × 100`, clamped to 100. Requires exactly 2 `question_ids`: `[implemented_qid, planned_qid]`. |
| `multi_select_proportion` | Count of selected options ÷ `total_items` × 100 |

The backend loops over the components per parent EPS, averages the enabled ones, and buckets the overall percentage into ten 10% bins. The `drainage` component is `hide: true` because its formula is still being finalized — it stays in the config so it's obvious what's pending without losing the placeholder.

### 9. `escalation` — criteria-driven tables

Two tables (`monitoring` and `construction`), each a declarative list of `criteria` (rows to include) and `columns` (what to render per row).

```json
"criteria": [
  { "type": "option_equals", "question_id": 1749632647507, "value": "no", "label": "No water sample" },
  { "type": "threshold_gt",  "question_id": 1749633220746, "value": 0,    "label": "E.coli above threshold" },
  { "type": "threshold_gt",  "question_id": 1749633220745, "value": 5,    "label": "Turbidity above threshold" }
]
```

The frontend **serializes this list** into the `criteria=` query-param format the backend expects:

```
criteria=option_equals:1749632647507:no,threshold_gt:1749633220746:0,threshold_gt:1749633220745:5
```

A row appears in the table if **any** criterion matches (inclusive OR). Each criterion can carry its own `hide: true` to drop a rule without deleting it — handy for "temporarily relax turbidity threshold during the rainy season".

Columns work the same way: a list of `{ key, source, question_id? }` serialized into a comma-colon string. Supported `source` values: `parent_name`, `administration`, `answer`, `latest_date` (backend), plus frontend-computed sources like `violations`, `computed_progress`, `expected_progress`, `answer_date`.

### 10. `map`

Single-entry block with:
- `source_form_id` — the registration form whose datapoints are plotted (each has `geo` coords),
- `status_question_id` / `status_monitoring_form_id` — the monitoring answer used to color markers,
- `status_colors` — option-value → hex mapping,
- `click_url_template` — where to route on marker click. `{parent_form_id}` and `{data_id}` are replaced at render time.

### 11. `layout` — what shows up and in what order

`layout.{tab_key}.sections[]` is a flat list of section objects. Section `type` values drive a small frontend component registry:

| `type` | What it renders |
|---|---|
| `kpi_row` | A horizontal row of KPI tiles referenced by `kpis[]` string keys |
| `chart_grid` | An N-column grid of charts referenced by `charts[]` string keys |
| `chart` | A single chart referenced by `chart_key` |
| `map` | The map widget |
| `section_title` | A text heading |
| `parameter_grid` | All water-quality parameters matching `group`, laid out in `columns` columns |
| `escalation_table` | Renders `escalation[escalation_key]` |
| `progress_breakdown` | Renders per-component progress bars for a `progress_ref` |

A section's `hide: true` drops it without affecting the underlying definitions — and definitions in `kpis`/`charts`/etc. that nothing references are never rendered. This means you can experiment by adding/removing one string from a layout list instead of touching the definition blocks.

### 12. Filter propagation (how the pieces fit together at runtime)

This is the load-bearing bit. The frontend maintains a global `filterState`:

```js
const filterState = {
  dateRange: [from, to],
  administrationId: 12,
  custom: { implementing_agency: "ngo_a", water_committee: "active" }
};
```

For **every API call**, it builds `params = { ...widget.api, ...commonFilters }`, where `commonFilters` comes from `filterState`. So changing the date picker refetches every widget with the new `from_date`/`to_date`. Custom filters are only merged into calls whose `form_id` matches `filters.custom[].form_id`.

This means: **a widget's `api` block is not a request — it's a template.** The runtime request is `api + commonFilters`.

### 13. The `hide` flag, recap

`hide: true` is the recommended way to disable anything. It is cheap, reversible, and shows intent (e.g., "drainage component is known-missing"). Prefer it over deleting blocks during development or gradual rollout. Per the Known Gaps table at the bottom of this doc, drainage is the current canonical example.

### 14. Adding a new widget — checklist

1. **Pick the API shape** (`/values`, `/escalation/{form_id}`, or `/progress/{form_id}`).
2. **Define it** under the matching top-level key (`kpis`, `charts`, `progress`, `escalation`).
3. **Reference it** in the right `layout.{tab}.sections[]`.
4. **Ship with `hide: true`** if it's experimental.
5. **Remove `hide`** when ready.

No backend work unless the widget genuinely needs a new formula or data source that the generic API can't express — at which point the decision point is either (a) add a new `formula` to `progress_functions.py` + `VALID_PROGRESS_FORMULAS`, or (b) compute it in the frontend using existing API responses.

### 15. What the config does **not** own

- **The data model.** All question IDs must exist in the referenced forms. The config is not a schema.
- **Permissions.** Admin-hierarchy filtering is enforced by the visualization endpoints based on user role, not by the config.
- **Form definitions.** If a question ID changes (e.g., a form is re-seeded), the config must be updated.

## Design Principles

1. **Frontend-owned config** — no backend config files
2. **Pass-through rendering** — API response matches akvo-charts props
3. **Reusable** — swap JSON to build a dashboard for any form family
4. **Filter propagation** — common filters apply to all API calls
5. **`hide` flag everywhere** — toggle items on/off without removing config entries

---

## The `hide` Property

Every top-level config item (tabs, KPIs, charts, parameters, escalations, layout sections) supports a `hide` boolean. The frontend renders only items where `hide !== true` (default: visible).

**Why**:
- Temporarily disable an item without deleting its definition
- Roll out new metrics gradually (hidden in production until ready)
- A/B test layouts
- Keep historical config while changing what's shown

**Example**:

```json
{
  "kpis": {
    "total_registered": { "hide": false, "label": "...", "api": {...} },
    "experimental_kpi": { "hide": true, "label": "Beta metric", "api": {...} }
  }
}
```

`hide` also works in layout `sections[]`, so you can hide an entire row/table without unregistering the underlying definitions.

## Frontend Rendering Rules

### Hide Logic

Before rendering, the frontend filters out any item with `hide === true`:

```js
// Tabs
const visibleTabs = config.tabs.filter(t => !t.hide);

// KPIs referenced in a section
const renderKpi = (key) => {
  const kpi = config.kpis[key];
  if (!kpi || kpi.hide) return null;
  return <KPICard config={kpi} />;
};

// Charts
const renderChart = (key) => {
  const chart = config.charts[key];
  if (!chart || chart.hide) return null;
  return <ChartRenderer config={chart} />;
};

// Water quality parameters by group
const renderParamGrid = (group) => {
  const params = config.water_quality.parameters
    .filter(p => p.group === group && !p.hide);
  return params.map(p => <ParameterChart config={p} />);
};

// Layout sections
const renderSection = (section) => {
  if (section.hide) return null;
  switch (section.type) { /* ... */ }
};

// Escalation criteria — only active ones go into the URL
const activeCriteria = esc.api.criteria
  .filter(c => !c.hide)
  .map(formatCriterion)
  .join(",");

// Escalation columns — only visible ones
const visibleColumns = esc.columns.filter(c => !c.hide);

// Progress components — only enabled ones counted in overall
const activeComponents = prog.api.components.filter(c => !c.hide);
```

---

## How the Frontend Consumes This Config

### 1. KPI Card — `total_registered`

```
const kpi = config.kpis.total_registered;
if (kpi.hide) return null;

const params = { ...kpi.api, ...commonFilters };
const url = buildQueryString("/api/v1/visualization/values", params);

fetch(url) → { data: [{ value: 150, label: "Total" }], labels: ["Total"] }

render: <Statistic title={kpi.label} value={response.data[0].value} />
```

### 2. Doughnut Chart — `operational_status`

```
const chart = config.charts.operational_status;
if (chart.hide) return null;

const params = { ...chart.api, ...commonFilters };
const url = buildQueryString("/api/v1/visualization/values", params);

fetch(url) → {
  data: [
    { value: 90, label: "Operational", group: "operational", color: "#64A73B" },
    { value: 20, label: "Issue with the system", group: "issue_with_system", color: "#e41a1c" }
  ],
  labels: ["Operational", "Issue with the system"]
}

render:
  <Doughnut
    config={{
      ...chart.config,
      color: response.data.map(d => d.color)
    }}
    data={response.data.map(d => ({ name: d.label, value: d.value }))}
  />
```

### 3. Water Quality Parameter — `e_coli`

```
const param = config.water_quality.parameters.find(p => p.key === "e_coli");
if (!param || param.hide) return null;

const params = { ...param.api, ...commonFilters };
const url = buildQueryString("/api/v1/visualization/values", params);

fetch(url) → {
  data: [
    { value: 0, label: "EPS Navua", group: "245170944" },
    { value: 3.5, label: "EPS Sigatoka", group: "245170945" }
  ],
  labels: ["EPS Navua", "EPS Sigatoka"]
}

const rawConfig = buildThresholdRawConfig(param.threshold, param.config.yAxisLabel);

render:
  <Bar
    config={param.config}
    data={response.data.map(d => ({ eps: d.label, value: d.value }))}
    rawConfig={rawConfig}
  />
```

### 4. Escalation Table — `monitoring` tab

```
const esc = config.escalation.monitoring;
if (esc.hide) return null;

// Only active criteria go to the API
const criteriaStr = esc.api.criteria
  .filter(c => !c.hide)
  .map(formatCriterion)
  .join(",");

// Only visible columns
const visibleColumns = esc.columns.filter(c => !c.hide);
const columnsStr = visibleColumns.map(formatColumn).join(",");

const url = buildQueryString(
  `/api/v1/visualization/escalation/${esc.api.form_id}`,
  {
    monitoring_form_id: esc.api.monitoring_form_id,
    criteria: criteriaStr,
    columns: columnsStr,
    page: currentPage,
    page_size: 20,
    ...commonFilters
  }
);

fetch(url) → { count, next, previous, results: [...] }

render:
  <Table
    columns={visibleColumns.map(c => ({ title: c.label, dataIndex: c.key }))}
    dataSource={response.results}
    pagination={{ total: response.count, pageSize: 20 }}
  />
```

### 5. Construction Progress

```
const prog = config.progress.construction;
if (prog.hide) return null;

// Only active components go into the API call
const activeComponents = prog.api.components.filter(c => !c.hide);
const componentsStr = activeComponents.map(formatComponent).join(",");

const url = buildQueryString(
  `/api/v1/visualization/progress/${prog.api.form_id}`,
  {
    monitoring_form_id: prog.api.monitoring_form_id,
    components: componentsStr,
    filter_question_id: prog.api.filter_question_id,
    filter_option_value: prog.api.filter_option_value,
    ...commonFilters
  }
);

fetch(url) → { histogram: [...], details: [...] }

// Histogram chart
<Bar
  config={config.charts.construction_progression.config}
  data={response.histogram.map(h => ({ bucket: h.progress, count: h.count }))}
/>
```

### 6. Compliance Stacked Bar (frontend computed)

Shape of the chart: x-axis has two categories, `Yes` and `No`. The `Yes` bar is a single "Compliant" stack segment. The `No` bar stacks one segment per parameter, where each segment's height is the number of EPS that failed that parameter (an EPS that fails multiple parameters contributes to each of its failing segments, so the `No` stack total ≥ count of non-compliant EPS).

```
// Fetch all non-hidden water quality parameter values in parallel
const params = config.water_quality.parameters.filter(p => !p.hide);
const allResponses = await Promise.all(
  params.map(p => fetch(
    buildQueryString("/api/v1/visualization/values", {
      ...p.api,
      ...commonFilters
    })
  ))
);

// Merge responses by EPS id (row.group === FormData.id)
const byEps = {};
allResponses.forEach((response, idx) => {
  const key = params[idx].key;
  response.data.forEach(row => {
    (byEps[row.group] ??= {})[key] = row.value;
  });
});

// Classify each EPS, tallying per-parameter failures for the "No" stack
const yesRow = { compliance: "Yes", Compliant: 0 };
const noRow  = { compliance: "No"  };
params.forEach(p => { noRow[p.label] = 0; });

for (const eps of Object.values(byEps)) {
  const failed = params.filter(p => !checkThreshold(eps[p.key], p.threshold));
  if (failed.length === 0) {
    yesRow.Compliant += 1;
  } else {
    failed.forEach(p => { noRow[p.label] += 1; });
  }
}

const chartData = [yesRow, noRow];
const stackLabels = ["Compliant", ...params.map(p => p.label)];

render:
  <StackBar
    config={config.charts.drinking_water_compliance.config}
    data={chartData}
    xKey="compliance"
    stackKeys={stackLabels}
  />
```

`checkThreshold(value, { min, max })` returns `true` when `value` is within range. Missing values (EPS never reported that parameter) should return `true` — they are "no data", not a violation. If you want a third bar for "No data", set `include_no_data: true` in the chart config and add a matching branch here.

### 7. Expected Progress (frontend computed)

For each EPS row in the construction escalation list:

```
const today = new Date();
const startDate = new Date(startDateAnswer);  // from 1749624452910
const deadline = new Date(deadlineAnswer);    // from 1749630516825

const daysElapsed = (today - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
const totalPlannedDays = (deadline - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
const expectedProgress = Math.min(
  (daysElapsed / totalPlannedDays) * 100,
  100
);
```

---

## Filter Propagation

All API calls automatically include common filters from the filter bar:

```
const commonFilters = {
  from_date: filterState.dateRange[0],
  to_date: filterState.dateRange[1],
  administration_id: filterState.administrationId,
};

// For each API call:
const params = { ...chart.api, ...commonFilters };
```

**Custom filters** (`implementing_agency`, `water_committee`) only apply to API calls where the `form_id` matches `filters.custom[].form_id`. The frontend config layer handles this mapping.

---

## File Location

```
frontend/src/pages/dashboard/configs/
└── 1749623934933.json
```

Registry:

```
// frontend/src/pages/dashboard/configs/index.js
import epsConfig from "./1749623934933.json";

export const dashboardConfigs = {
  1749623934933: epsConfig,
};

export const getDashboardConfig = (formId) =>
  dashboardConfigs[formId] || null;
```

---

## Reusability

To add a dashboard for a new form family:

1. Create `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/configs/{formId}.json`
2. Copy the EPS config as a template
3. Replace `parent_form_id`, monitoring form IDs, and all question IDs
4. Adjust `tabs`, `kpis`, `charts`, `progress`, `escalation`, and `layout` sections
5. Use `hide: true` to temporarily disable items during incremental rollout
6. Register in `configs/index.js`

**Zero backend code changes** — the generic API serves any form family.

---

## Known Gaps

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Drainage component progress formula | **Pending definition** — `hide: true` in config until spec is final |
| "Fiscal year" exact start month | **Configurable** via `filters.date.fiscal_year_start_month` (default July) |
| Compliance stacked-bar colors | Derived from config; validate against design mockup on implementation |
| EPS name column source | Uses `parent_answer:1749624452994` on the registration form rather than the auto-generated datapoint name |
| Fecal coliform parameter | `hide: true` — QID `1749633295165` is defined in the water-quality form but not shown on the design. Un-hide once stakeholders confirm whether to render it in the Microbial grid |
| Accessibility issues tile/column | **Pending QID** — rendered as a placeholder in the EPS-at-a-Glance section and the monitoring escalation table's last column until a form question is assigned |
